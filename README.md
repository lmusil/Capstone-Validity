# Capstone-Validity
Capstone Project, Checking Validity in Metadata: Focus ISO 19115/19139
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) valid metadata used for describing data in a geographic information system cataloged environment.  Geospatial metadata will be highlighted using geographic spatial data, XY coordinates, that are visually emphasized by the use of a Map Viewer, also known as a Web Map.

# Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a visual understanding of the importance of metadata while providing guidance for the process of valid (ISO) metadata creation.


# 1.	Data:
The acquisition of a dataset which aids in the creation of visually mapped data points, and yet the metadata developed for the dataset in question must be relatively clean even in its rawest form so that time restraints can be met.  This need is often no different than when working in the field of informatics and metadata acquisition, there is usually a short deadline. The dataset used for this project (likely censuses spatial data) will be visual represented on a web map or map viewer which displays the geographic information data. 

# 2.	Tools: 
Finding tools that can aid in the creation of metadata, without being too complicated or time consuming is a difficult task. For this project there will be a couple background JAVA Web Applications aiding me for this hurdle. Some examples of metadata tools include CIM (common information model) tools which aid in the viewing and validation of metadata which is encoded in XML formats. Another example of a metadata tool is MERMAid which is an online tool which aids in the creation, validation, editing, and storing and exporting metadata sets from such entities as NOAA Costal Data Development Center. These types of tools provide meticulous validation of metadata (www.fgdc.gov/metadata/geospatial-metadata-tools).

# 3.	Standards and Validation: 
Metadata in most scientific repositories must be valid against a particular set of standards, such as ISO requirements. These standards (schemas) are established to control the quality of metadata, so when attempting to harvest onesâ€™ metadata into another catalog it checks your metadata against the schema in the catalog you are attempting to harvest into.  If there are faults, the metadata records will not be accepted.  To resolve some of the issues with picky validation schemas the project will contain low-quality metadata using default entries, as well as high quality metadata that provides all the necessary fields without having to use NULL or UNKNOWN comments.  This will help create a visual for the audience on why even the smallest details are important.
